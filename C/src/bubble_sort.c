/**
 * @file sample_sort.c
 * @brief Implementation of the Sample Sort algorithm.
 * 
 * This file contains functions to create, manage, and sort a list of elements
 * using the Sample Sort algorithm. The functions include creating an initial
 * list, adding and removing elements, deleting the list, and performing
 * the sorting operation.
 * 
 * @section pseudo_code Pseudo Code
 * 1. Create an initial list with N elements.
 * 2. Divide the list into parts and sort each part.
 * 3. Merge sorted parts into a final sorted list.
 * 
 * @section complexity Complexity
 * - Time Complexity: O(N log N) for average case, where N is the number of elements.
 * - Space Complexity: O(N) for storing elements.
 * 
 * The time complexity is calculated based on the number of comparisons and
 * swaps required during the sorting process. The space complexity includes
 * additional space for the list and temporary storage during sorting.
